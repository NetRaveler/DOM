I am learning about DOM manipulation from https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/dom-manipulation

I will be using the DOM to add and manipulate elements on the page

---------
So far I have learned what the node tree is, how to target different
elements within that node tree, how to add event listeners.
